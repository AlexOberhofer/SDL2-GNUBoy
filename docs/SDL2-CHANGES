This document outlines the changes present in this fork.

The main purpose of this port/project has been to port the Gnuboy SDL feature 
set to SDL2 and provide modern builds and build files for GNUBoy. GNUBoy was introduced
to me via an arduino port, so getting the old codebase working on modern Linux, then
Mac and Windows. I have ported the SDL rendering and joystick code, with small changes to
the SDL sound engine. 

The original documentation is included in this repository, and is still semi valid. As this program
comes with no warranty or support, you are on your own if you have issues. Hopefully these legacy
documents can help in that case.

KNOWN ISSUES:
- Scale only works in 1x, 2x, 3x
- Compiling with sound disabled can cause timing issues 

Feel free to fork or contribute!
